# snakes
The classic game [Snake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game)) written in pure Javascript (no additional libraries).

To run just open index.html in a browser.

By default, both wasd and arrow keys move the player, while a computer player with basic ai will try to eat more apples than you.
